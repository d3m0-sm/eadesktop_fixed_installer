# eadesktop_fixed_installer

The official EA Desktop installer might not work for everyone without trouble, so this installer assistant fixes the problems with it.

The installer assistant also fixes the issue that the start menu entry doesen't work.

I recommend to not create a desktop shortcut trough the install setup off EA, because this is a shortcut to the EALauncher.exe and this might not work for everyone.
So if you want a desktop shortcut, i recommend to create it during the dialog in the installer assistant after the EA setup.

Note: You do not need to download the EA Desktop installer. The assistant is going to download it by itself
