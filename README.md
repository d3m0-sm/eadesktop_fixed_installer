# eadesktop_fixed_installer

The official EA Desktop installer might not work for everyone without trouble, so this installer assistant fixes the problems with it.

After the suscessfully installation you might not be able to start EA Desktop trough the Desktop or Start menu link.
So you have to go in the instalation directory of EA Desktop, 

(by default: "C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\EA Desktop\EA Desktop")

and create a link og the "EADesktop.exe" by your own.
I will add this step as an automated feature to the application in the future
